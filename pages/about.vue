        <h2 class="text-lg">History</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mt-4">
          Established in 1993, our company played a crucial role in the early development of pharmaceutical trade in Nigeria. Our first major transaction involved supplying medicines to the Nigerian Army, marking the beginning of a trusted relationship with the healthcare sector.  
          Rooted in Africaâ€™s rich trading history, we trace our origins back to the Royal Nigeria Company, a key player in commerce during the colonial era. This company eventually became part of the United African Company (UAC), a historic trading powerhouse that was later acquired by Unilever.  
          Through these historical foundations, our mission has always been clear: to expand the reach of quality medicines, connecting Africa to the world.
