        <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mt-4">
          Founded in 1992 by Micheal F. Ngoo, our company was officially registered on June 4, 1993.  
          The vision was born during Nigeriaâ€™s military era, when the Nigerian Army Medical Corps played a crucial role in pharmaceutical distribution. The need for regulated, high-quality medicines in a rapidly evolving healthcare system contributed to the eventual formation of NAFDAC (National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control).  
          Our journey has been defined by a commitment to ensuring safe, accessible, and effective medicines across Nigeria and beyond.
